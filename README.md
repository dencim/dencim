# Hi there, I'm Denis ðŸ‘‹ 

## Computer Science @ Ontario Tech University 

I started my programming journey 7 years ago in early highschool developing <b>Android</b> games in Unity<b>(C#)</b> and publishing them to the Play Store and
I followed my passion into a <b>Computer Science</b> Program at <b>Ontario Tech University</b>. I am currently in third year and am thankful for the wide range of knowledge and guidance given to me by members of the faculty. They got me passionate about subjects I did not even know existed when I chose to enroll!<br><br>

I have used my knowledge to develop many personal projects from <b>Python Computer Vision Applications</b> to <b>Java Socket Applications</b> to <b>Full Stack Web Applications (MERN stack) </b>& many more as well as many more to come <br>
